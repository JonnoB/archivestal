# To Do

- Pixtral based image parsing and block classification: The pixtral model can probably parse the structure of a page very efficiently, breaking an image into classified bounding box areas such as.
    - headings
    - text
    - images
    - tables
    - adverts
    - special text (poems)
- There are issues with bounding  box errors, these can probably be cleaned up using heuristics or a simple ML algo as the boxes are usually very wide.
